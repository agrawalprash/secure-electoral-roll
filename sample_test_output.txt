IndRAudit passed for Accept receipt for beta=2.
Accept receipt size estimate: 
        Accept registration receipt size estimate: 
        - 4 ZR elements per ciphertext (x7)         = 28 ZR elements
        - 5 ZR elements for uid, rp, vid, j and ed  =  5 ZR elements
        - 2 ZR elements for rhoenc1                 =  2 ZR elements
        - 2 ZR elements per rhoenc2 component (x3)  =  6 ZR elements
        - 2 ZR elements per rhoeq1 component  (x3)  =  6 ZR elements
        - 2 ZR elements per rhoeq1 component  (x3)  =  6 ZR elements
        TOTAL                                       = 53 ZR elements.

        Assuming an elliptic curve where order q ~ 250 bits, each ZR element
        takes 250 bits, so the overall size requirement is 13250 bits ~ 1.65 KB,
        which can fit within standard QR codes.
        
        All other receipts are smaller.
    
IndRAudit passed for Reject receipt.
IndRAudit passed for DupReg receipt.
UnivAudit's ERR audit steps passed.
